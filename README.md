# Lab2-JS-frameworks

# Assignment Contents:
This assignment will be a demonstration about your skills in importing and using custom modules according to
what we have done in the last lecture of working with Node.js.
To emphasise on the purpose of learning and encouraging all the students to participate using their own creative ideas
instead of following fixed steps and instructions, I have designed this lab to give you a general overview/idea about the
topics/tools that you will need to demonstrate leaving the code examples and duties to you.

# Assignment Instructions:

# First JavaScript server file:
1. Any name you prefer to be used as the entry point to run/lunch your application using node commands
2. You will just call/invoke a list of the functions that you created in the second JavaScript file.
a. You need import the other JavaScript file that contains the function
b. You can use either CommonJS or ES modules syntax

# Second JavaScript server file:
1. Any name you prefer to be used as a utilities file where you can save your functions, objects, or another data to be
used/called by the other JavaScript file
2. Creating at least 4 different functions to do these tasks:
a. First Function: no return, just accepting a text as an input with any number of parameter and print it by
concatenating it with labels/other text.
i. Example: the function might have two parameters: first name and last name and print/output:
“Welcome first name last name to G@I College”
b. Second Function: return a double value for converting a measurement unit to another one, it can accept a
double single value as parameter for the initial measurement unit.
i. Example: the function might have one parameter for the Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit (or
vise - versa) or converting minutes to hours (or vise – versa) etc...
c. Third Function: to do any math operation against a numeric value(s), it can accept one, or more than one
value (argument) and then return the result of applying a math formula
i. Example: the function might have one parameter and return the factorial of that value
d. Fourth Function: any advanced function of your choice
